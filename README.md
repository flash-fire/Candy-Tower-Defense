Candy-Tower-Defense
===================
This is a post final version of Sugar Tower Defense. 
Changes have been made to the code after the 2013 Heartland Gaming Expo, rendering some elements unusable. 
It is unlikely this will be repaired. The game is still playable, but the ability to sell towers that have been purchased is not currently available.
